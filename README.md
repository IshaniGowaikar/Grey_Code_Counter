# Grey_Code_Counter
The objective of this lab is to learn simple sequential logic circuit design and verification using schematic  capture and digital simulation tools. 

Function:  
o Design a 3‐bit grey code counter. The counting sequence for grey code is 000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 
111, 101, 100. Use D‐FFs to implement the counter.  
 
Inputs: 
clock: Clock signal 
 
Outputs: 
o[2:0]: Grey code outputs
